# CONNA: Addressing Name Disambiguation on the Fly

CONNA is a framework to address the problem of continues name disambiguation, a classical paper assignment task,  in the current academic platforms, such as, Google Scholar, DBLP, and AMiner. More details please refer to: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12202 .



CONNA has been further modified accroding to the online needs, denoted as CONNA++, and deployed on [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn/)  which acts as the core algorithm for the effective paper assignment. 



We also apply CONNA++ to a name disambiguation competition (https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/chaindream_nd_task2/) . Now, we still maintain the 1st rank in the [leadboard](https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/chaindream_nd_task2/leaderboard/), and we will also release the code of CONNA++ at the end of the competition.



 

### Name Disambiguation Data 

For more and cleaner name disambiguation data, we highly recommend *WhoIsWho*, **the world largest manually-labeled name disambiguation benchmark**, which contains nearly **1,000,000** papers annotated by crowdsourcing, and can be easily accessed in its dataset page,
