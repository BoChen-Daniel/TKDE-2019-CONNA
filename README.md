## TKDEâ€˜19 basic implementation code

This is basic implementation of our TKDE'19 paper:

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow-gpu
- GPU,CUDA,CUDNN

Note: Running this project will consume upwards of 100GB hard disk space. The overall pipeline will take several hours. You are recommended to run this project on a Linux server.

## Code & Instructions
Comming soon...


## Data Source
All experimental data is available.
OAG-WhoIsWho: (link: https://www.aminer.cn/whoiswho)
KDD-Cup: (link:)

Note: Due to the data file which should be added to run the code is too large, (e.g. embedding words file, the per-trained checkpoints file,etc) we just upload our basic code now. After we have carefully sorted out the code and data, we will upload the complete version again.
